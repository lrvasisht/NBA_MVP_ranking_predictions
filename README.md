# NBA_MVP_ranking_predictions
In this project I scraped data from popular NBA scores site and predicted MVP seasonal rankings.
This project consists of jupyter notebooks which I developed in Kaggle and thus, some functionality is restricted to kaggle notebooks only.
It consists of two parts. First, data scraping and second developing machine learning algorithms.
Further this project is ongoing, where I intend to train model LTSM nueral network model and compare the results from previous ML models.
